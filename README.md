# Fortuna

### Block cipher

The block cipher used is a public domain implementation of [AES-256](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard), in the code it uses the original name Rijndael. The reason for not using Javas own implementation is to avoid the system configuration changes needed to be allowed to use it.

### Entropy sources

For entropy sources I've selected _TODO_
